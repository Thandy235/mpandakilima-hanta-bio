            <!-- Government experience -->

            <!-- Current role and responsibilities -->
            <p>Today, as <strong>Financial Insight's regional face in Kitwe</strong>, Hante wears multiple hats: photographer capturing Zambia's business landscape, videographer producing compelling visual narratives, on-camera host for educational content including the popular <strong>"2 Minutes with Hante"</strong> series, and strategic manager growing FI's Copperbelt presence.</p>

            <!-- Music career integration -->
            <p>But there's another dimension to Hante's creative identity: <strong>music</strong>. Since 2017, he has maintained a professional music career alongside his media work, releasing original compositions and performing across the Copperbelt. Far from being a separate pursuit, music has become the creative laboratory where Hante hones the skills that define his media work: understanding rhythm and pacing, reading audiences in real-time, controlling emotional tone, and knowing precisely when to hit the crescendo for maximum impact.</p>
